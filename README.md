# Potato Days

### a guide for couch potatoes on potato days

I took part in a coding bootcamp focusing on Java development.
This is my capstone project.

Every day, we get recommendations for lots of things. 
While they often mean well, our peers keep recommending movies and tv shows for us, but once we finally have time to watch them, we have already forgotten about them, and we end up rewatching the same shows over and over again.

Potato Days is an application that lets you save movie and tv show recommendations by friends, family, coworkers - or just simple advertising.

Once you finally have some time off and get to be a couch potato, you can take a look at the list and hopefully find a good way to spend your time. :)
